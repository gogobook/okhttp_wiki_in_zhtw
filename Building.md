OkHttp requires Java 7 to build and run tests. Runtime compatibility with Java 6 is enforced as part of the build to ensure compliance with Android and older versions of the JVM.

### Desktop Testing

Run OkHttp tests on the desktop with Maven. Running HTTP/2 and SPDY tests on the desktop uses [Jetty-NPN][1] when running OpenJDK 7 or [Jetty-ALPN][2] when OpenJDK 8.

```
mvn clean test
```

### Device Testing

OkHttp's test suite creates an in-process HTTPS server. Prior to Android 2.3, SSL server sockets were broken, and so HTTPS tests will time out when run on such devices.

Test on a USB-attached Android using [Vogar][3]. Unfortunately `dx` requires that you build with Java 6, otherwise the test class will be silently omitted from the `.dex` file.

```
mvn clean
mvn package -DskipTests
